    <h2>Who to put as center</h2>
    <p>In multi lives, this is the only skill that activates - if you need a healer, put it here. Usually the best option is a scorer - everyone benefits from this. In solo lives it doesn't really matter.</p>

        <h2>What to do when you have less than 5 3*+ cards</h2>
        <p>I didn't add 2*s to the band creator, because it's unlikely you have less than 5 3*+ cards - if you don't, you should definitely consider scouting, no matter what you're saving for. If you can't make it, same rules apply as for higher rarity cards: girl and attribute match 2*s are better than attribute match 2*s are better than girl match 2*s.</p>

        <h2>What to do about area items and levelling up your cards</h2>
        <p>Take it easy! Level the area items up as time goes by, you'll be at max level for all of them soon enough. They're super useful, but not more useful than trained cards.</p>
        <p>As for cards, you'll usually be able to level them up during the event. Say you're starting at an almost ideal team, but all cards are level 1 - put one or two of these cards with high level cards until your team can make your desired room or get the desired amount of points. It's always a bit of trial and error, but you can do this when you're at 0 flames and not lose too many points.</p>

        <h2>What to do when you play on a different server</h2>
        <p>I'm sorry about the extra effort, but you'll have to click away cards that aren't available yet! Let me know if you think I should attempt taking server availability into account!</p>

        <h2>Normal Events</h2>
        <h3>Team:</h3>
        <p>Normal Event Team. Center should be a scorer if possible.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Play:</h3>
        <p>Multi Lives</p>
        
        <hr>
        <h2>Challenge Live Events</h2>
        <h3>Team:</h3>
        <p>Normal Event Team. Center should be a scorer for Multi Lives, if possible. In Challenge Lives, you have to figure out what works best - scorers matter, but attribute and girl matches get a stat boost (on JP).</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Play:</h3>
        <p>Multi Lives; Challenge Lives using 200CP (event points multiply for 400 and 800CP, rewards like Miracle Crystals don't!)</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Band Battle Events</h2>
        <h3>Team:</h3>
        <p>Build the strongest team you can ignoring the boosted attribute and member (focus on same band, then same attribute for higher area item bonus) or - especially on JP where one stat gets boosted if girl and attribute match - go for a normal Event Team. Watch out - your score gets boosted in this event type, not the actual event points - having matching attribute and members might put you at disadvantage, into a room with people much stronger than you. I recommend doing a few test plays since it's hard to tell what ultimately works best.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Play:</h3>
        <p>Band Battle Lives. Event song for quick runs.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 8px; display: inline">Please don't play the event song in the other room.</p>
        <p>Take care: Flames are spent as you enter the room, not when the live starts. People disconnecting or failing a live tends to be to your advantage if you're mostly going for event points.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Marina's Lottery:</h3>
        <p>Get all the Flame Refills! Lots of super good rewards, and the last box (number 6) resets as many times as you like.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Live Try Event</h2>
        <h3>Team:</h3>
        <p>Normal Event Team for regular playing, any band you need to clear the goals (healer band, locker band etc.)</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Play:</h3>
        <p>Multi Lives with your Event Team when you have flames, any live with any team if you don't.</p>
